* [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs][Spacemacs]] within [[http://tmux.github.io/][tmux]] within a [[https://www.docker.com/][Docker]] container 

** The [[https://github.com/jgmize/dotfiles/blob/master/.tmux.conf][tmux config]] has been customized to be closer to screen and vim
*** The tmux bind key is ctrl+a

* Usage Examples

** map the current directory to =~/src= in the container
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
docker run -itv $(pwd):/home/spacemacs/src quay.io/jgmize/spacemacs-tmux
#+END_SRC
** map the current directory to =~/src= in the container and use the host =.ssh= and =.gitconfig=
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
docker run -it \
  -v $(pwd):/home/spacemacs/src \
  -v $HOME/.ssh:/home/spacemacs/.ssh \
  -v $HOME/.gitconfig:/home/spacemacs/.gitconfig \
  quay.io/jgmize/spacemacs-tmux
#+END_SRC

* Caveats and Workarounds

-  Attempting to detach with the tmux keybinding =ctrl+a d= will kill
   the container, but you can detach via the docker keybinding
   =ctrl+p ctrl+q=
-  Attempting to attach to the running tmux session with =docker exec=
   and =tmux attach= will fail with
   =open terminal failed: not a terminal=, but =docker attach= works
